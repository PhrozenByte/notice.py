notice.py
=========

`notice.py` is a cross-platform notification client written in Python to send desktop notifications using a simple command line interface, providing drop-in replacements for [libnotify's `notify-send`](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libnotify/) and [vlevit's `notify-send.sh`](https://github.com/vlevit/notify-send.sh), based on [samschott's `desktop-notifier`](https://github.com/samschott/desktop-notifier) library.
